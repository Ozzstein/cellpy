:param: r_d = diffusion resistance [ohm]
:param: r_ct = charge-transfer capacity [ohm]
:param: v_co = cut-off voltage (assuming initial value) [V]
v_co is actually not initial value in this case because the of ohmic
resistance, r_0, isn't incorporated in this example. r_0 will make the v_co
jump almost instant to a higher value. In real applications, r_0 need to be
properly incorporated in ocv voltage. It's basically just to add a voltage
v_0 that will add to the final ocv voltage.
